# The Last of Us Story

## Overview
The Last of Us is a third-person action-adventure game, set in a post-apocalyptic world where a deadly parasitic fungus (Cordyceps unilateralis) that infects the brains of ants suddenly adapts to humans. A large portion of the human race turns into monster, called the infected or clickers. The remaining survivors turn to whatever assets they can find to survive a world now overrun by anarchy and desolation.
