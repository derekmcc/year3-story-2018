            <h3>Winter</h3>
            <p>
                Ellie hunts deer for food, but her hunting is soon cut short as she encounters two men. They appear friendly at first, as the older man David sends the other to collect the medicine Ellie requires. She still expresses distrust of David, though the two are inevitably forced to work together to defend against a horde of infected. Ellie sets aside her suspicions and the two are able to ward the infected off.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as the two make camp, David reveals that he is the leader of the pack of Hunters that attacked them at the hospital earlier. David still hands her the medicine, and Ellie quickly escapes and returns back to Joel.
            </p>
            <p>
                David sends his men to follow her, forcing Ellie to ride away on horseback in an attempt to keep them away from Joel. After riding a fair distance Ellie silently kills her way through the pack of Hunters, and is eventually caught by David.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now trapped within a butcher's shop, David inadvertently reveals that his group has resorted to cannibalism. However, his intended use for Ellie is not food, but is instead sexual. After Ellie rejects David's attempts to court her into his group, he instead decides to kill her for food. While lying on a butcher's table, she bites David and quickly exclaims that she's infected. Amidst the confusion, she is able to escape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elsewhere, Joel has recovered, and upon realizing Ellie has gone missing, he kills his way through the remaining Hunters at the house. He is forced to torture and kill two of them in order to gain information of her whereabouts.
            </p>
            <p>
                David sets fire to a restaurant exit to stop Ellie from escaping. She is able to use her cunning and her honed skills in stealth to stab David with his own machete. Joel, noticing the fire, arrives just after and tries to calm her down.
