            <h3>Summer</h3>
            <p>
                The Last of Us stars Joel, a 50-something man who is one of the few remaining people left in the world after a parasitic fungus began infecting the population. During the very early stages of the outbreak, 20 years before the main game begins, Joel's daughter Sarah is killed amidst the chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, Joel is a smuggler, and his latest job is to help escort Ellie, a 14 year old girl, out of his city. The city is under martial law and combat with a rebel group known as the Fireflies is frequent. He is to take her to a Firefly base at the request of the Firefly leader Marlene. Ellie is immune to the disease and her blood is believed to be the key for creating a cure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two encounter many allies along their travels, all of whom will either die or stay behind once they've done all they can do. Initially Joel is working alongside his smuggling partner Tess, though she is bitten by an infected and then sacrifices herself to stall the pursuing Government authorities. Next is Bill, an old friend of Tess and Joel's who lives alone in a small deserted town. He aids the two, but then retreats back to his safe haven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally Joel and Ellie reach is Henry and Sam, two brothers who were initially apart of a larger group, but broke apart and were attempting to reunite with whoever is left at a nearby radio station. They travel alongside Joel and Ellie, as the four fight their way through infected, and Hunters - bandits who kill and steal from whoever enters their territory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The four finally manage to reach the radio station, however the younger brother Sam was bitten earlier and turns overnight. He attacks Ellie and forces Joel to react, but not before he is held at gunpoint by Henry. After much pleading from Joel, Henry kills his little brother and quickly pulls the gun on himself and commits suicide.
            </p>
