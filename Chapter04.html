    Once again the two advance upon their destination. Along the way they encounter a tower of giraffes, and they both share a serene moment while watching the gentle creatures walk by amidst the sunny backdrop. Further along their travels, Joel and Ellie are thrown underwater by a crumbling underground bridge. Joel is able to quickly reach Ellie, who cannot swim, and begins to resuscitate her. She doesn't appear to be waking up, and armed men arrive and knock Joel out.

    He awakes inside a hospital, greeted by Marlene, and realizes he made it to the Firefly base. Though alive, Ellie is not with him. Marlene explains that in order for them to extract the necessary samples to create a cure, Ellie must die.

    Joel refuses to let them kill Ellie, and fights his way through a swath of Firefly soldiers until he reaches the surgery room. He kills the head surgeon and takes Ellie in his arms, rushing through the corridors until he reaches the elevator. He heads down to the car park to find himself held at gun point by Marlene, who begs Joel to give Ellie back. Joel is able to fire a round into Marlene before she can react. Marlene begs for her life while bleeding on the floor. Joel refuses mercy claiming that she would still come after Ellie, and shoots Marlene point-blank in the head.

    Ellie soon wakes up in Joel's car and asks what happened. Joel lies to her, stating that no cure exists, and that the Fireflies had already tried with other individuals who were immune and it didn't work. Ellie, clearly confused and disappointed, appears to accepts this for the truth.
