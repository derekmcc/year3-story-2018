            <h3>Autumn</h3>
            <p>
                Joel and Ellie continue their travels until reaching a dam. Inside is a small settlement, lead by Joel's own brother and ex-Firefly Tommy. While there, Joel plans to hand Ellie over to Tommy, whom he believes will have a better chance getting her to safety because of his prior connections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ellie, distraught at the idea of being abandoned after the two have begun to establish a strong father-daughter bond, takes off from the base by horse. Joel and Tommy are eventually able to catch her, and Joel then decides to carry on the duty of escorting Ellie.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two finally reach the Firefly base, an abandoned hospital, only they find it deserted. There are audio logs explaining that the Fireflies had to move on from the area. With a new location set, the two begin to carry on their journey. However, they are ambushed by Hunters on their way out. The two fight their way to the exit, and Joel punctures his stomach after falling from the first floor and landing on a pipe. Ellie is then forced to tend to his wounds, after setting up base in an abandoned house, and look for medicine.
